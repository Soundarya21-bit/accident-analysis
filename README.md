 # FARS 2007 Accident Analysis

Analyzing road accident data from the FARS 2007 dataset to identify key trends, patterns, and safety insights using data science techniques.

---

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project involves **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the 2007 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset, provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The goal is to uncover patterns related to fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United States and provide actionable insights for improving road safety.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System) 2007
- **Files Used**:
  - `accident.csv`: Crash-level data
  - `vehicle.csv`: Vehicle-level data
  - `person.csv`: Person-level data

- **Attributes include**:
  - Date & time of crash
  - Weather and road conditions
  - Vehicle body type, maneuver, and travel speed
  - Driver and passenger attributes
  - Crash severity and location

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Plotly (for interactive charts)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- Top states with highest number of fatal accidents
- Monthly, weekly, and hourly distribution of accidents
- Impact of weather and road conditions on crash severity
- Distribution of accidents by vehicle body type and maneuver
- Age and gender-wise fatality analysis
- Time of day vs. accident severity
- Heatmap and correlation analysis between multiple crash-related variables

## 📁 Files

- `FARS_2007_Accident_Analysis.ipynb` – main EDA and insights notebook
- `accident.csv`, `vehicle.csv`, `person.csv` – raw data files (separate or zipped)

---

## 📌 Summary & Insights

The project uncovered several meaningful insights such as:

- Most fatal accidents occur during weekends and nighttime.
- Poor lighting and adverse weather significantly contribute to crash severity.
- Passenger cars and pickups are most commonly involved in fatal crashes.
- Young adults (21–30) are more frequently involved in high-severity crashes.
- Alcohol-related crashes peak during late night hours.

These findings can help traffic safety authorities focus on preventive measures like better lighting, driver education, and stricter DUI enforcement.

## 📊 Visualization Examples

- Bar plots showing accident distribution by state and month
- Pie charts for vehicle types involved
- Heatmaps for correlation between crash factors
- Time series plots for crash trends across the year
